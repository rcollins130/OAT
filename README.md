OAT: Optical Aircraft Tracker

System for tracking aircraft optically. Ground-truth data is provided by ADS-B transponder capture. Project consists of two main sections:
- Data collection: Shell scripts & C++ to initiate a data collection sequence. Runs onboard a Raspberry Pi with attached DSLR camera and software-defined radio.
- Data processing: MATLAB tools for detecting & tracking aircraft, parsing ADS-B logs, outputing processed capture results.
